Lots of different std::function alternatives can be found in main.cpp.

To compile and run locally using the Makefile you will need to have Google's Benchmark library (https://github.com/google/benchmark) available on your system.

To reproduce the figures in the slides you can paste the code contained in main.cpp into Quick Bench (http://quick-bench.com) and comment out the last line.
